    "## SCENARIO\n",
    "VanArsdel is a company that manufactures and sells sporting goods. The company has offices in the United States (US) and several other countries. Its sales comprise of US sales and International sales. VanArsdel’s sales come from its owned manufactured products, as well as other manufacturers’ products.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have successfully brought the US sales data from the Access database and the International sales data from a collection of CSV files to Power BI Desktop. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can start analyzing your data, you need to manage the table relationships within your data model and create new ones if necessary. To do so, you might need to create calculated columns or calculated tables for the relationships to be based on.\n",
    "Once you have all the relationships created, you can create visualizations and start to analyze the data. However, you need to create additional measures to perform more advanced analysis with your data, which includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Comparing current year YTD sales and last year YTD sales.\n",
    "- Comparing sales of VanArsdel's manufactured goods to other manufacturers.\n"
