# M-Language

1. Power Query is a Formula Language (Informally known as "M")
2. **M** stands for **Mash-Up**
3. **M** is a case-sensitive language
4. Power Query is a data transformation and data preparation engine. Power Query comes with a graphical interface for getting data from sources and a Power Query Editor for applying transformations. Because the engine is available in many products and services, the destination where the data will be stored depends on where Power Query was used. Using Power Query, you can perform the extract, transform, and load (ETL) processing of data.

### Exercise 1: Write Simple M-languge Query

1. Open **Power BI Desktop** > Click on **Get Data** > Click on **Blank Query** > In **Power Query Editor** > Click on **Advanced Editor** > Then copy paste below code

``` F#
let
    x = 1 +1,
    y= x+2,
    z = y+3
in
    z
```
1. Click on done
2. Click on apply and close
3. develop report and observe output
### Exercise 2: Write Simple M-languge Query with spaces in variable name.

1. Replace above code with below code and observe result

``` F#
let
        #"First Name" = "Ram",
        #"Last Name" = "Reddy",
        #"Full Name" = Text.Combine({#"First Name", #"Last Name"})
in
        #"Full Name"
```
            
            
 ### Exercise 3: Call functions in M-language

1. Replace above code with below code and observe result

``` F#
//this is a single line comment
/* This
is 
a
multiline
comment*/

let
   date = #date(2021,04,25),
   year = Date.Year(date)
in
    year
```
### Exercise 4: Real world example

1. Open any one PBIX file and observe M-language code
2. In screenshot below, you can see all basics mentioned so far:
        - **let** and **in** block
        - Variable names matching steps applied in the query
        - Some variable names with hashtag and double quote: #”var name”
        - End of the line characters: **comma**
        - Calling many functions
